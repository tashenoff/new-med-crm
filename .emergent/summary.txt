The AI engineer successfully enhanced a medical record application through a series of feature implementations and critical bug fixes. Initially, work focused on implementing categories for service pricing, fixing a persistent tooth unit selection bug in , and resolving multiple  issues in . Significant effort was also directed towards correcting calculation errors in treatment plan statistics, which showed negative or incorrect sums. The engineer then integrated a full treatment plan editor into  to mirror  functionality. Following this, a Specialties management system was added, including backend API, a dedicated frontend component, and integration into . This process involved correcting navigation placement and ensuring the dropdown rendered correctly. Before this summary, the engineer fixed doctor statistics 500 errors and search functionality bugs. The immediate ongoing task is integrating a new Payment Types feature, including backend models, API endpoints, and a new frontend component, which is currently being added to the application's navigation.

The application manages medical records, patient data, appointments, and treatment plans.
**Key Features & Fixes Implemented by AI Engineer:**
1.  **Service Price Management**: Implemented a Directory in the sidebar with a Price Policy section. This allows managing service categories (name only, mandatory for service creation) and service prices, handling per tooth pricing using .
2.  **Bug Fixes**: Addressed 500 errors in patient and doctor statistics, JavaScript  in appointment modal, incorrect summation and negative values in treatment plan statistics,  errors in doctor search, and authentication (401) issues.
3.  **Scheduling Enhancements**:  was transformed into a Kanban board with drag-and-drop. Doctor scheduling and availability checks were implemented. A pending task remains to add quick status switching in .
4.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Patient selection in  became a search field. The patient editing modal () was enhanced to include full treatment plan editing functionality (with  and ), though a UI rendering bug remains.
5.  **Doctor Management**: Added Specialties management as a dedicated section under Directory. Doctors can now be assigned a specialty via a dropdown during creation/editing.
6.  **Navigation Refinements**: Adjusted Specialties and Doctor Statistics placement in the sidebar for clarity and correct routing.
7.  **Payment Types**: Currently, a new section for Payment Types is being added to the Directory with management of payment type names and commissions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating a new feature: **Payment Types**. This feature allows administrators to manage different payment methods and their associated commission rates.

The work completed so far for this feature includes:
1.  **Backend Model Creation**: New Pydantic models,  and , have been added to  to define the structure for payment type data (e.g., name, commission rate).
2.  **Backend API Endpoints**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for  have been implemented in , allowing the frontend to interact with payment type data in the MongoDB database.
3.  **Frontend Component Creation**: A new React component, , has been created within  to house the user interface for managing payment types.

The last explicit action stated by the AI engineer was ## **Шаг 3: Добавляем в навигацию**, indicating that the current, immediate task is to integrate this newly created  component into the application's sidebar navigation structure, specifically as a sub-item under the Справочник (Directory) menu, alongside Ценовая политика (Price Policy) and Специальности (Specialties).
