The AI engineer successfully guided the medical record application from an MVP to a feature-rich system. Key achievements include implementing automatic medical record creation, expanding patient and appointment data, and introducing robust document management with upload/download capabilities. The engineer adeptly handled UI refactoring by extracting components, resolving critical bugs like duplicate modals and environment variable access, and debugging complex API routing issues. The development process was iterative, responding to user feedback and progressively enhancing features. The most complex phase involved building a comprehensive treatment planning system, integrating new backend models and frontend components like  and . At the point of summary, the engineer was in the process of integrating these new components into the frontend modals.

The initial problem was the absence of medical record creation functionality. The user desired an automated process where an empty medical record would be created upon patient registration. Subsequently, doctors needed the ability to edit existing medical records to add details like blood group, height, weight, emergency contacts, and insurance information. The system also required features for adding diagnoses, medications, and medical entries (notes for visits), with automatic entry creation upon appointment completion. UI improvements were requested, including consistent appointment displays across schedule/calendar views, day-by-day calendar navigation, and general error fixes.

During the development trajectory, the following enhancements were requested:
1.  **Expanded Medical Entry Fields**: Adding new fields to the medical entry form, initially for general medical entries, then specifically for Patient and Appointment forms, including birthday, gender, referrer, financial data (revenue, debt, overpayment), appointment details (end time, chair number, patient notes, price, source), and simplification to a single doctor per appointment.
2.  **Document Management**: Ability to upload, view, and download documents for a patient directly within the patient profile modal and the appointment booking modal, displayed under a Документы (Documents) tab.
3.  **Treatment Plan Management**: Introduction of a План лечения (Treatment Plan) tab in both patient profile and appointment booking modals. This evolved to include a detailed system for treatment plans with categories of services, prices, and a dental chart for tooth selection.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the enhanced План лечения (Treatment Plan) functionality, particularly focusing on the frontend integration. This involved:

1.  **Backend Models and Endpoints for Services**: New  model (name, category, price, description) and corresponding API endpoints () were added to  to manage treatment services. This backend part was tested and reported as working correctly.
2.  **Frontend Components for Treatment Plan**:
    *    was created, intended for graphical tooth selection.
    *    was created, designed for selecting services.
3.  **Integrating Service Selection in AppointmentModal**: The AI engineer was actively modifying  to replace simple text fields in the План лечения tab with the new  component. This process involved addressing and resolving linting errors and duplicate function declarations ().

The last action recorded was the AI engineer taking a screenshot, indicating an attempt to visually verify the ongoing integration of the treatment plan components. The implementation of the detailed treatment plan, including displaying service categories, prices, and the dental chart, is currently in progress on the frontend.
