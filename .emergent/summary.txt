The previous AI engineer successfully evolved a medical record application from an MVP. Initial efforts focused on automatic medical record creation, patient/appointment data expansion, and document management. A significant phase involved building a comprehensive treatment planning system, integrating backend models and frontend components like  and .

The trajectory then details a series of iterative enhancements and bug fixes. Key issues resolved include authentication (401 errors requiring login) and treatment plan saving (422 validation error due to redundant ). Feature additions include detailed treatment plan statistics, general and doctor-specific statistics with search capabilities, and a major UI overhaul to implement a collapsible sidebar navigation with an accordion menu for statistics. The process involved constant backend and frontend updates, often debugging in response to user feedback. The work concluded with the user reporting that the source/channel field for clients had been inadvertently removed.

The initial core problem was the absence of medical record creation. The system needed to automatically generate empty medical records upon patient registration, allowing doctors to subsequently edit them with details like blood group, height, weight, emergency contacts, and insurance. Functionality for adding diagnoses, medications, and medical entries (visit notes) was also required, with automatic entry creation post-appointment. UI consistency was a priority for appointment displays across views, alongside general bug fixes.

Subsequent enhancements included expanding medical entry fields for patients (birthday, gender, referrer, financial data) and appointments (end time, chair number, patient notes, price, source). A key feature was comprehensive document management, enabling upload, viewing, and download for patients via dedicated Документы tabs in both patient and appointment modals. A detailed План лечения (Treatment Plan) system was introduced, featuring service categories, pricing, and a dental chart for tooth selection, accessible through a dedicated tab. Later, a request for an Statistics page for treatment plans (tracking execution, missed payments, unpaid plans) was added. This evolved to include detailed doctor statistics and a collapsible sidebar navigation with an accordion menu for different statistical views, along with search functionality for patients and doctors. The most recent implicit request is to restore the source/channel field for client appointments.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API endpoints, database interactions, and data models.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded  and  models. Added , , ,  models for new features. Implemented CRUD operations for these models and their respective API endpoints (, , ). Introduced  for file storage and a  endpoint for file downloads. Fixed a 422 validation error by making  optional in . Added  and  fields to  and implemented new API endpoints for treatment plan statistics () and doctor statistics ().

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The central component for routing, global state management, and overall application layout.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to integrate new patient and appointment fields into forms. Critical bug fix involved removing duplicate modal definitions. Added state management for new UI tabs and introduced  state and  function for the new collapsible sidebar. Integrated the new  component (later replaced by  and ) into the main view, controlling visibility based on active tabs. Managed user authentication state and logout logic, which was crucial for resolving initial 401 errors. Updated layout structure to accommodate the sidebar.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Enables creation and editing of appointments, now including detailed patient and treatment plan management.
    -   **Changes**: Extended with input fields for new appointment attributes (end time, chair, patient notes, price). Integrated document upload/management under a Документы пациента tab. Significantly updated to include a План лечения tab, which now incorporates the  and  components for comprehensive treatment plan creation. Form state () was updated to include  and  fields, with corresponding UI elements added for these new statuses.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays the application's header and provides navigation controls.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include a hamburger menu button () for controlling the new collapsible sidebar. The application title Мед Ассистент was removed from this component to avoid duplication after it was moved into the sidebar. Adjusted z-index for the hamburger button to ensure clickability.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides the main navigation links for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Transformed into a collapsible left sidebar component. Implemented logic to show/hide based on  state, supporting both desktop and mobile responsiveness. Critical changes involved integrating an accordion menu structure for the Статистика section, allowing sub-categories like Планы лечения and Врачи to expand/collapse. The  structure was updated to define these nested navigation links.

-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: A newly created component for graphically selecting teeth in a dental treatment plan.
    -   **Changes**: This component was added early in the trajectory but its full integration into the treatment plan form within  was an ongoing task.

-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: A newly created component for selecting services to be included in a treatment plan.
    -   **Changes**: This component was added early in the trajectory, with its integration into 's План лечения tab being an ongoing task.

-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: A dedicated component for displaying statistics related to treatment plans.
    -   **Changes**: Created by splitting functionality from the original . Includes overview, monthly, and patient-specific statistics for treatment plans. Enhanced with a search input, filtering logic for patients, a display for the number of found records, a clear search button, and a message for no search results.

-    (NEW):
    -   **Importance**: A dedicated component for displaying statistics related to doctors.
    -   **Changes**: Created by splitting functionality from the original . Includes overview, monthly, and doctor-specific statistics. Enhanced with a search input, filtering logic for doctors, a display for the number of found records, a clear search button, and a message for no search results.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Added styles for the new collapsible sidebar, the accordion menu functionality within the navigation, and specific styles for the search input fields within the statistics components.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in addressing a bug reported by the user: the accidental removal of the source (источник/канал) field, which tracks how a client was acquired. The user provided an image highlighting its absence.

The AI engineer's last action was initiating an investigation into the  file to verify the presence of the  field within the  model. This indicates the start of the process to restore this crucial piece of data. The current state is that the field is confirmed missing, and the next step is to re-integrate it into the backend data models and then propagate the changes to the frontend forms and display logic. This bug is a regression, as the field was likely present before and now needs to be re-added.
