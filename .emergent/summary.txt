The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic MVP application into a more robust and functional medical record system through an iterative development process. The trajectory shows a clear progression from initial problem diagnosis (why medical records couldn't be created) to implementing complex features like automatic medical record creation, detailed medical history tracking, and extensive UI refactoring. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in debugging, addressing user-reported issues (e.g., UI display, API errors, syntax errors), and proactively suggesting architectural improvements (component separation). The development style was incremental, with frequent user interactions for clarification and confirmation, ensuring alignment with product requirements. A key challenge was managing a large  file, which was meticulously broken down into smaller, manageable components and hooks, significantly improving maintainability. The engineer also effectively debugged API routing issues and data validation problems, showcasing a deep understanding of both frontend and backend interactions. The latest phase involves enhancing the medical record entry form with new fields.

<product_requirements>
The primary problem was the inability to create patient medical records, and the user needed to understand the current state and the appropriate stage for medical record creation.
Initially, the application allowed only viewing existing medical records, lacking creation functionality (no Create button, form, or logic). The backend had a functional  POST endpoint but was unused by the frontend. Medical records were not automatically created upon patient registration or first appointment.

The AI engineer proposed and implemented the following:
1.  **Mandatory Medical Record Creation:** Initially, the user requested that a medical record be *required* before the first appointment.
2.  **Automatic Medical Record Creation:** This was refined to *automatically create an empty medical record upon patient creation* (user's preferred logical flow).
3.  **Medical Record Editing/Enrichment:**
    *   Ability for doctors/administrators to edit existing medical records (blood group, height, weight, emergency contacts, insurance).
    *   Inclusion of appointment history and the ability for doctors to add diagnoses and medications directly within the medical record.
    *   Automatic creation of medical entries when an appointment status changes to Completed.
    *   Manual medical entry creation.
4.  **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Fixing appointment display inconsistencies between Расписание (Schedule) and Календарь (Calendar) sections.
    *   Improving calendar usability: current day highlighted, navigation by day (not week), starting with today's date.
    *   Fixing various frontend errors (e.g., ,  property access, React object rendering).
    *   Adding a natural background image.
5.  **New Medical Entry Fields:** The latest request involves expanding the medical entry form with new fields (provided via image) and updating the database accordingly.

        *   Ensured API endpoints correctly map to  prefix.
        *   Refined medical summary aggregation to include , , .
        *   Updated  model to ensure correct data validation and field handling (e.g., Thu Aug 21 07:37:04 UTC 2025 with default,  as optional).

*   :
    *   **Importance:** Originally a monolithic file containing all UI logic, state, and API calls. Now acts as the main orchestrator, managing global state and routing between refactored components.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Massive refactoring: Extracted , , , , , , , , , , , ,  into separate component files.
        *   Integrated  and  hooks for API and medical-specific logic.
        *   Implemented automatic medical record creation logic upon patient creation ().
        *   Removed old medical record creation logic and related checks from .
        *   Corrected API URLs to include  prefix for all backend calls.
        *   Fixed various syntax and runtime errors arising from refactoring and missing variables (e.g., , ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two primary user concerns:
1.  **Medical Record Entry Error (422 validation error):** The user was reporting an error when attempting to add an entry to a medical card. This was traced down to two issues:
    *   Incorrect API URLs: The frontend was sending requests to URLs like  instead of , causing 401/422 errors due to incorrect routing and authentication issues. This was fixed by correcting all relevant API paths in  and .
    *   Data validation for  field: The frontend was sending  (empty string) instead of  for the optional importance field, causing a 422 error. This was fixed by initializing  to  in the form state and filtering out empty optional fields before sending the API request. The  was also updated to correctly handle the  value.
2.  **Calendar Display (single day, navigation):** The user requested that the calendar should only show the current day, not a 7-day range, and navigation should be day-by-day. This was implemented in  by adjusting the date range calculation and modifying navigation buttons to increment/decrement by a single day. The Today button and current day highlight were also implemented.

The last action performed was receiving a user request to update the medical entry form with new fields based on an uploaded image, and the AI engineer confirmed understanding this request and planned to start with backend modifications. The  component was created, but its full integration might still be pending.
