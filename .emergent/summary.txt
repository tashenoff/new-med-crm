The AI engineer successfully enhanced a medical record application by addressing multiple user requests and bug reports. Initial work involved fixing a 500 error in the patient statistics endpoint by adding division-by-zero checks in . Following this, a Kanban-style schedule view was implemented in , with visual drag-and-drop improvements. A significant feature added was doctor scheduling, requiring new models and API endpoints in  and integration into  and  for availability checks and filtering. Doctor statistics were expanded in  and  to include hours worked and utilization, with detailed tooltips for clarity. The patient selection in  was transformed into a search field, and subsequent bugs related to residual not found messages and modal state on re-opening were fixed. Most recently, a Directory with a Price Policy section was added for managing service prices, integrated into , , and . The final ongoing task involves integrating this new price directory with the  and  components, specifically to handle services priced per tooth and to ensure correct unit selection in the UI.

<product_requirements>
The application's core goal is efficient medical record management. Initially, it required automatic medical record creation, patient/appointment data expansion, and document management. Key features included a comprehensive treatment planning system with  and , and robust statistics for treatment plans and doctors.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **Bug Fixes**: Resolve 500 errors in patient statistics, Patients not found message persistence after selection, and empty modal windows on reopen.
2.  **Scheduling Enhancements**: Transform the appointment schedule into a Kanban board with drag-and-drop. Implement a doctor scheduling system allowing doctors to set their working days/hours, preventing appointment bookings outside these times, and filtering doctors in the calendar view based on availability.
3.  **Statistics Expansion**: Add hours worked and % utilization columns to doctor statistics, along with explanatory tooltips.
4.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Replace the patient selection dropdown in the appointment modal with a search field.
5.  **Service Price Management**: Create a Directory in the sidebar with a Price Policy section to manage treatment plan service prices. Integrate these dynamic prices into the appointment modal's treatment plan selection, specifically handling services priced per tooth by allowing tooth selection via the  component.

<pending_tasks>
- **Restore Source/Channel Field**: Re-introduce the source field for client appointments in the backend  model and update all relevant frontend forms (e.g., ) to capture and display this information. (This was an initial pending task from the system prompt which was not addressed in the trajectory.)
- **Fix Tooth Selection in Service Price Integration**: Address the issue where the зуб (tooth) unit is selected by text instead of value in the service addition form, preventing correct integration of  and price calculation based on selected teeth.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating the  component with the  to handle services priced per tooth within the treatment plan section of the appointment modal. This involved updating  to allow multiple tooth selections and modifying  to dynamically show the  when a service with зуб as a unit is selected, calculating the price based on the number of selected teeth, and adding explanatory tooltips.

The last specific action taken was an attempt to fix an issue reported by the user regarding the selection of the зуб (tooth) unit in the service addition form. The AI engineer observed that the selection was not working correctly, specifically that the unit зуб was being selected by its text rather than its underlying value, leading to incorrect functionality. The engineer's last thought explicitly stated the need to fix this.
