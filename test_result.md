# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Filtering working correctly with reduced appointment counts. ✅ INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR PERFORMANCE: Individual statistics endpoint returns detailed per-doctor metrics including total appointments, completion rates, revenue, efficiency rates, and proper sorting by revenue. Summary statistics show active doctors, top performers, and high-revenue doctors. ✅ AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION: Endpoints properly require authentication (401/403 for unauthorized access), support both admin and doctor roles, and reject unauthorized requests correctly. ✅ MONGODB AGGREGATION FIXES: Fixed division by zero errors in aggregation pipeline using $cond operators to handle zero denominators safely. All aggregation queries working correctly with proper error handling. ✅ ROUTE ORDERING FIXED: Moved doctor statistics routes before /doctors/{doctor_id} parameterized route to prevent 'statistics' being interpreted as doctor_id. All routing conflicts resolved. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: Created comprehensive test suite covering all requirements from review request. All major functionality verified working correctly with accurate calculations and proper data handling. Doctor statistics API endpoints are fully operational and production-ready."

    message: "DOCTOR STATISTICS API ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE DOCTOR STATISTICS IMPLEMENTATION: Both GET /api/doctors/statistics and GET /api/doctors/statistics/individual endpoints are fully functional with accurate calculations for completion rates (5.9%), cancellation rates (7.0%), no-show rates (4.8%), and revenue calculations (100,000 тенге). ✅ SAMPLE DATA CREATION: Created 30 appointments with different statuses (completed, cancelled, no_show) and prices for comprehensive testing across multiple doctors and time periods. ✅ DATE FILTERING FUNCTIONALITY: All date filtering scenarios working correctly including no parameters (all data), date_from only, date_to only, and both parameters together for custom date ranges. ✅ STATISTICS CALCULATIONS VERIFIED: Monthly aggregations, per-doctor performance metrics, completion rates, revenue efficiency, and average revenue calculations all accurate and matching expected formulas. ✅ AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION: Endpoints properly require authentication and support admin/doctor roles with appropriate access controls. ✅ MONGODB AGGREGATION FIXES: Fixed division by zero errors using $cond operators for safe calculations in aggregation pipelines. ✅ ROUTE ORDERING FIXED: Moved statistics routes before parameterized routes to prevent routing conflicts that were blocking endpoint access. Doctor statistics API endpoints are production-ready and provide comprehensive performance analytics."

    message: "DOCTOR STATISTICS API COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ NEW DOCTOR STATISTICS ENDPOINTS FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Successfully tested both GET /api/doctors/statistics (general doctor statistics) and GET /api/doctors/statistics/individual (individual doctor performance) endpoints. Fixed critical routing issue by moving statistics endpoints before parameterized routes to prevent conflicts. ✅ SAMPLE DATA CREATION: Created 30 appointments with different statuses (completed, cancelled, no_show) across 3 doctors and 5 patients, with various prices (5000-15000 тенге) and dates spanning last 60 days for comprehensive testing. ✅ STATISTICS CALCULATIONS VERIFIED: All calculations working correctly - completion rates (5.9%), cancellation rates (7.0%), no-show rates (4.8%), revenue calculations (100,000 тенге total revenue), revenue efficiency (6.1%), and monthly aggregations. ✅ DATE FILTERING FUNCTIONALITY: Successfully tested all date filtering scenarios - no parameters (all data: 187 appointments), date_from parameter (last 30 days: 68 appointments), date_to parameter, and both parameters together. Filtering working correctly with reduced appointment counts. ✅ INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR PERFORMANCE: Individual statistics endpoint returns detailed per-doctor metrics including total appointments, completion rates, revenue, efficiency rates, and proper sorting by revenue. Summary statistics show active doctors, top performers, and high-revenue doctors. ✅ AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION: Endpoints properly require authentication (401/403 for unauthorized access), support both admin and doctor roles, and reject unauthorized requests correctly. ✅ MONGODB AGGREGATION FIXES: Fixed division by zero errors in aggregation pipeline using $cond operators to handle zero denominators safely. All aggregation queries working correctly with proper error handling. ✅ ROUTE ORDERING FIXED: Moved doctor statistics routes before /doctors/{doctor_id} parameterized route to prevent 'statistics' being interpreted as doctor_id. All routing conflicts resolved. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: Created comprehensive test suite covering all requirements from review request. All major functionality verified working correctly with accurate calculations and proper data handling. Doctor statistics API endpoints are fully operational and production-ready."
