# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Files return HTML instead of actual content. ✅ Document upload/retrieval APIs work perfectly. ✅ File storage, metadata, access control all functional. DIAGNOSIS: Backend code is correct, but external routing configuration must be fixed to route /uploads/* to backend (port 8001) instead of frontend (port 3000).

    message: "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Fixed the original issue by adding automatic empty medical record creation when creating patients. Also added editing interface so doctors can fill medical data. Now workflow is: 1) Create patient -> auto-creates empty medical record, 2) Doctor can edit medical record anytime via Edit button, 3) No more blocking of appointments due to missing medical records."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully verified that medical records are automatically created when creating a new patient. The PUT endpoint for updating medical records works correctly. Creating appointments works without issues since medical records are automatically created. Duplicate medical record creation is properly prevented. All backend tests passed successfully."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "ADDITIONAL TESTING COMPLETED: Ran comprehensive tests for automatic medical record creation. Verified that: 1) Medical records are automatically created when a new patient is created, 2) The patient_id is correctly set in the medical record, 3) The medical record contains empty fields as expected, 4) The system prevents duplicate medical record creation, 5) Patient creation succeeds even if there would be an issue with medical record creation (error handling). Server logs confirm the auto-creation with messages: '✅ Auto-created medical record for patient'. All tests passed successfully."

    message: "ENHANCED MODELS TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested all enhanced patient and appointment model features. ✅ Enhanced Patient Model: Created patients with birth_date, gender, referrer fields. Financial fields (revenue, debt, overpayment) and count fields (appointments_count, records_count) properly initialized and updatable. All fields returned in GET requests. ✅ Enhanced Appointment Model: Created appointments with end_time, chair_number, assistant_id, second_doctor_id, extra_hours, patient_notes. MongoDB aggregation correctly populates assistant_name and second_doctor_name from doctor lookups. ✅ Existing Functionality: Automatic medical record creation works with enhanced patients. Time conflict detection works with enhanced appointments. Backward compatibility verified - simple patients/appointments get correct defaults. ✅ Fixed aggregation pipeline issue using $ifNull operators for missing fields in older records. All 13/13 enhanced model tests passed successfully."

    message: "CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE DISCOVERED: ✅ Backend static file serving is FULLY FUNCTIONAL on internal port (localhost:8001/uploads) - files are served correctly with proper content-types and content. ❌ EXTERNAL ROUTING BROKEN: /uploads requests via production URL (https://medentry-portal.preview.emergentagent.com/uploads) are being served by frontend React app instead of backend. This is a Kubernetes ingress configuration issue. ✅ Document upload/retrieval APIs work perfectly. ✅ File storage and metadata management working correctly. ✅ Access control and error handling functional. DIAGNOSIS: Backend implementation is correct, but external routing needs to be configured to route /uploads/* to backend instead of frontend. This prevents file downloads from working externally despite backend functionality being complete."
